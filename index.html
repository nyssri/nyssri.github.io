    Hi, my name is Sarathi and I hope you enjoy your visit to my website.  As a professional, I've spent most of my career as a product manager in large banking institutions where I designed software for various business areas.  I'm now making a transition over to the startup environment so I can work on different types of challenges.  On a more personal level, I enjoy being outside, watching or playing sports, travel, learning languages, and messing around with my guitar.
