        Hi, my name is Sarathi.  I used to work in the financial industry but realized it was time to explore my creative side by working on solving problems that I could more easily relate to.  I am a product manager with experience in web design and always consider the user's experience.
      </p>
    <br>

      <p class="about-me-text" id="">
        Some of my personal passions include (but are certainly not limited to) travel, learning foreign languages, personal finance, sports, Fintech, and food tech to name a few.  I'd love to help someone build something amazing in one or more of those spaces and if I can't find someone to work with, maybe I'll do something myself.  Take some time to learn more about me and then let's do something cool together.
      </p>

    <h2 class="section-heading">Professional details</h2>

      <p class="about-me-text" id="">
        After I left the banking industry, I took some time to learn new skills.  I learned UX Design at General Assembly and did an 8 week full-time program at the Startup Institute focusing on Web Design.  I've also gotten a Web Design certificate from <a href="http://www.nobledesktop.com" target="_blank">Noble Deskop</a> and have decided to expand my horizons further by enrolling in a part-time iOS course at <a href="http://turntotech.io/8-week-ios-course/" target ="_blank">Turn to Tech</a>.  As you can see, I'm always eager to learn.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="about-me-text" id="">My years of work experience centered around my product management, analytical, and communication skills where I designed complex functional solutions for banking products and managed the product backlog.
      Now, I want to help you solve your problems and build something amazing.  If you have a website design that needs to be implemented, need help with creating a design, or just need someone to help you get things organized and move your project forward, I can help.  Take some time to explore <a href="#">my work</a> and let's do something together.
      </p>
      <br>
    
      <p class="about-me-text" id="last-p">Or, I can offer you some travel advice on one of the 30+ countries I've been to.
