          <p class="problem-text"><span class="problem">Problem:</span>  Despite their desire to cook more often, novice cooks rarely know what to make nor have recipes handy when they are ready to start cooking.
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="more-text">
            <p><span class="problem">Approach:</span>  I went through a thorough process to determine the best solution for this problem.  I began by doing some research by interviewing people in my target audience to better understand their pain points with this process.
            </p>
            <p>After gathering user research, I followed up by doing some competetive analysis to see what kind of solutions were already out there.  Once I had a better understanding of the problem and the existing options, I came up with a solution of my own.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="problem">Solution:</span>  My solution was to create a mobile app which captured user meal preferences and to suggest meals they could prepare during the week.  The app would allow users to create a weekly menu and create a grocery list.
            </p>
            <p>My solution was turned into a series of wireframes which I tested with users through both low fidelity and semi-functional prototypes.

            <p><span class="problem">Scenario:</span>  I was asked by someone to take a look at an iOS app he created to provide my thoughts on it's usability and to make some recommendations on potential improvements.
            </p> 
            <br>
            <div class="more-text">
              <p><span class="problem">Approach:</span>  After learning a little bit more about what the app intended to do, I downloaded it and had a quick play.  I spent some time getting to know it a little better with an eye on it's usability.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><span class="problem">Recommendation:</span>  Among other things, my main recommendation was to make the onboarding process much cleaner.  In my opinion, new users were taken directly to the product listing page with very little understanding of what the app did or how it worked.
              </p>

            <div class="more-text">
              <p><span class="problem">Approach:</span>  The approach for this project was rather straightforward.  I wrote some HTML and CSS to duplicate the layout of a few pages.  The pages I created were then handed off to developer who was then going to write some PHP to make the pages dynamic that would ultimately be turned into a wordpress site.
