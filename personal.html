  			<p>On a personal level, there a few things that I enjoy.  I love to travel any chance I can get and I've been to 30+ countries.</p>
  			<p>I enjoy watching and playing sports.  I regularly play in softball and basketball leagues and am a proud Mets fan (for better or worse).</p>
  			<p>If I had more time, I'd probably spend time learning more languages.  The last language I attempted to learn is German.  I still have a long way to go.</p>
