<h2>The Year in Photos - 2015</h2>

	<h3 class="article-name">The World Series</h3>
	<h6 class="article-date">October 2015</h6>
	<p>The Mets made it to the world series this year and I was there!  Unfortunately, for me (and the Mets), it didn't end well.  But the core of the team is strong and next year should be a good one.

	<h3 class="article-name">Zion Narrows</h3>
	<h6 class="article-date">May 2015</h6>
		<p>Roughly around memorial day, we celebrated by wife's friends birthday by doing a small but absolutely beautiful hike The Narrows in Zion National Park.  The Narrows is the narrowest section of Zion Canyon.  It was amazing.

	<h3 class="article-name">Skiing in Vail</h3>
	<h6 class="article-date">January 2015</h6>
		<p>My wife and I kicked off the year with a trip to Vail.  Both of us enjoy skiing but rarely get a chance to go.  We creatively used our airline miles to get ridiculously good deal to Vail and did a couple of days of skiing with a couple of other people.  That was a lot of fun.
