  			<p>You can probably find most of my professional detail on my <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/sarathis1" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page but I can add a little bit more color here.  I have quite a few years of work experience and have spent my last several years as a product manager at an investment bank.  I recently realized it's time for a change so I enrolled with <a href="http://www.startupinstitute.com" target="_blank">Startup Institute in the Web Design track.</a>  If I hadn't enrolled, it possible this website never would have been born.</p>
  			<p>I'm motivated by the desire to learn new things and solve really interesting problems.  If I didn't have to pay bills I'd probably spend a lot of my time taking classes to learn languages and tons of other stuff like the UX Design course I took in 2014.<p>
